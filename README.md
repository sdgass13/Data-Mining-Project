# Data-Mining-Project

#Overview

This project seeks to build models that most accurately predict whether an individual had a favorable view of Donald Trump during the Republican Primaries from August-October 2015. The goal of this project is to produce accurate predictions from the models.

The data used is a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center from August 27-October 4, 2015. The survey conducted 6000 phone interviews with adults from all 50 states in the US. It asked the respondents various questions regarding their opionions on the US Government, prominent figures in politics, the direction the US is heading, the economy, and general political ideology. The survey also includes a number of demographic questions such as age, race, education, income, etc.

The response variable that we are using in our models is from the survey question "And is your overall opinion of Donald Trump very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly unfavorable, or very unfavorable". We have recoded the responses into a dummy variable TrumpY, which condenses very favorable and mostly favorable into 1 and mostly unfavorable and very unfavorable into 0.
